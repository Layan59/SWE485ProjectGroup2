# SWE485Project

My Role in the Project
🔹 Phase 1: Problem Understanding and Data Exploration

[BODOR]

    Collected and examined a relevant dataset aligned with our project’s goal.

    Provided samples of the raw dataset within the Jupyter Notebook for transparency.

    Created visualizations such as histograms and tables to show:

        Distribution of variables

        Missing values

        Statistical summaries (mean, variance, etc.)

    Helped with initial preprocessing, including identifying and handling missing data.

    Contributed to writing the dataset summary and description section.

🔹 Phase 2: Supervised Learning
[BODOR]

    Created a Jupyter Notebook in the “Supervised Learning” folder.

    Implemented multiple supervised learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees).

    Wrote code with detailed comments to improve clarity and reusability.

    Analyzed and interpreted the results of each algorithm to identify the best-performing model.

🔹 Phase 3: Unsupervised Learning
[BODOR]

    Evaluated clustering performance using metrics such as:

        Silhouette Coefficient

        Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)

        BCubed Precision and Recall

    Created visualizations (e.g., cluster plots) to demonstrate group separations.

    Discussed how clustering could enhance recommendations and its limitations.
