My Role in the Project


üîπ Phase 1: Problem Understanding and Data Exploration

[BODOR]
 ‚Ä¢ Collected and examined a relevant dataset aligned with our project‚Äôs goal.
 ‚Ä¢ Provided samples of the raw dataset within the Jupyter Notebook for transparency.
 ‚Ä¢ Created visualizations such as histograms and tables to show:
 ‚Ä¢ Distribution of variables
 ‚Ä¢ Missing values
 ‚Ä¢ Statistical summaries (mean, variance, etc.)
 ‚Ä¢ Helped with initial preprocessing, including identifying and handling missing data.
 ‚Ä¢ Contributed to writing the dataset summary and description section.

[WAAD]
 ‚Ä¢ Handled the initial preprocessing of the dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
 ‚Ä¢ Applied data cleaning techniques such as:
 ‚Ä¢ Removing columns with only NaN values using dropna(axis=1, how='all')
 ‚Ä¢ Dropping irrelevant features (e.g., ‚ÄòDisease‚Äô column before clustering)
 ‚Ä¢ Checking for duplicate rows and ensuring data integrity
 ‚Ä¢ Performed basic data formatting and ensured columns were properly structured.
 ‚Ä¢ Verified dataset readiness for modeling by inspecting data types and null distributions.

[HUTOON]
I worked on describing the goal of the dataset and its source. This included explaining the purpose of the data and where it was collected from.

[Abrar]
- Handled the preprocessing techniques for the selected dataset.
- Applied data cleaning steps


üîπ Phase 2: Supervised Learning

[BODOR]
 ‚Ä¢ Created a Jupyter Notebook in the ‚ÄúSupervised Learning‚Äù folder.
 ‚Ä¢ Implemented multiple supervised learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees).
 ‚Ä¢ Wrote code with detailed comments to improve clarity and reusability.
 ‚Ä¢ Analyzed and interpreted the results of each algorithm to identify the best-performing model.

[WAAD]
 ‚Ä¢ Finalized the data cleaning and transformation before model training.
 ‚Ä¢ Encoded categorical features if needed and standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.
 ‚Ä¢ Ensured the dataset was free of inconsistent entries, empty cells, or formatting issues.
 ‚Ä¢ Helped prepare a clean dataset that was directly used to train the models in this phase.

[HUTOON]
 I was responsible for testing supervised learning algorithms and comparing their results to help determine which models worked best.

 [Abrar]
 Implemented one of the supervised learning algorithms used in the project.



üîπ Phase 3: Unsupervised Learning

[BODOR]
 ‚Ä¢ Evaluated clustering performance using metrics such as:
 ‚Ä¢ Silhouette Coefficient
 ‚Ä¢ Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)
 ‚Ä¢ BCubed Precision and Recall
 ‚Ä¢ Created visualizations (e.g., cluster plots) to demonstrate group separations.
 ‚Ä¢ Discussed how clustering could enhance recommendations and its limitations.

[WAAD]
 ‚Ä¢ Created the Jupyter Notebook for this phase and implemented DBSCAN, K-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering (HAC).
 ‚Ä¢ Used StandardScaler for scaling features and applied PCA for visualizing clustering results in 2D.
 ‚Ä¢ Produced multiple visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, dendrogram, elbow method).
 ‚Ä¢ Explained the outcomes and compared the clustering algorithms based on performance metrics.

[HUTOON]
I handled the visualizations for clustering algorithms. I created clear visual representations for K-Means, DBSCAN, and HAC using PCA to show how the data was grouped.

[Abrar]

Designed and implemented the unsupervised learning algorithm (clustering) for the project.
‚Ä¢ Preprocessed the dataset for clustering (e.g., removing class labels).
